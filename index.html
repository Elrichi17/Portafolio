        <img src="imgs/yo.jpeg" alt="David Ricaurte">
        <p>I am David Ricaurte, a Systems Engineering student in my fifth semester at EIA University. 
            I was born in Medell√≠n 18 years ago, and since then, I have developed a deep passion for technology and programming. 
            Throughout my education, I have gained solid knowledge in various areas of engineering, with a particular focus on web development and languages such as HTML, CSS, React, and TypeScript.
            Currently, I am working on improving my skills in web development, both in design and functionality. My goal is to continue learning and refining my competencies to become a competent 
            and creative professional in the field of systems engineering.</p>

            <h3>Project Title 1</h3>
            <p>One of the most exciting projects I have worked on involves integrating an emotion detection model with an image recognition model. 
                The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive system capable of analyzing both textual and visual data to provide meaningful insights.

            Sure! Here is a brief description of your interests and hobbies:
            
            Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I have a variety of interests and hobbies that play a significant role in my life.
             I practiced BMX for several years, which not only kept me physically active but also taught me valuable lessons in perseverance,
              discipline, and the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I enjoy playing video games. This hobby is more than just a form of entertainment for me;
             it has honed my problem-solving skills, strategic thinking,
             and ability to work collaboratively with others in team-based games.</p>
